# aics-project

a general description of the project which should include:  

(i) what information can be found in other folders  
(ii) instructions how to run your system, what other componenets/datasets are required and where they can be obtained  
(iii) general work plan of the projects and a place to leave our comments. This is also the first file we will look at.  

code/: all code should go in this folder. For coding we recommend using Jupyter notebooks Links to an external site.. All steps required to run the code should be well documented, as well as individual parts of the code should be explained with comments. One should be able to run the code and replicate the process. 

data/: use this folder for datasets that you have created. Those that can be downloaded from elsewhere can be referenced in README.md and files that are created by your code should be in your folder on MLTGPU. If you need to upload large files to Github, you can use their Git Large File Storage Links to an external site..

library/: a place for any supporting files that you have used, for example required system configurations and other supporting files that cannot be obtained from open repositories.
notes/: To show the work that you have done (especially important if you get a negative result) you should keep a lab log as you work. This will also allow you to write the report faster. Use this folder with markdown text Links to an external site. files as a wiki to document your experiment and take notes as you go along. These files can also be edited and viewed on Github.

paper/: a place for your course report and presentation
